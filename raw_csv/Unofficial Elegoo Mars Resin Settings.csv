,Basic (ABS-Like),Clear Red,Amazon,0.05mm,8,80,10,0,0,ChituBox,Troy Lonie,Worked very well.  It was my first print with this resin so I was being very conservative; I also slowed the speeds way down

Monocure,Rapid,Grey,Amazon,0.05mm,5,65,5,0,0,ChituBox,Nikolai Iakoubenia,"Testing minimum exposure time with Ameralabs print. Bottom debossed logo just about shows, embossed doesn't, might be able to go a bit lower but resin seems to be quite viscous and creates a ""melty"" overhang angle."
MakerJuice WaxCast,Castable Resin,Orange,,0.025mm,5,90,30-50?,,,ChituBox,nmcvaugh,"Extremely finicky, but has potential. Closing in on settings that will work for my object, but have gotten mixed results. Requires .025mm to .03mm layers. Somewhere between 35 and 50 seconds per layer. Needs base layer on the build plate per VegOilGuy's Burn Castable Resin notes below. Adhesion to FEP is still a problem, testing RainX to see if this helps. "
PhotoCentric 3D,Firm Resin DLP Printers,White,PhotoCentric,0.05mm,6,90,18,0,0,ChituBox,Brecht Kuppens,"Bought the DLP resin because the LCD version was not available. Primed the build plate, 2 layers. Good results, still some minor over-exposure on ameralabs town test piece."

PowerCast,Castable Resin,BURN Opaque - Green,PowerCast,0.05mm,8,80,14,0,0,ChituBox,VegOilGuy,"Make sure to prime the build plate by brushing on layers of the resin. 4 layers worked, but less may work. Casts beautifly"

ResinWorks 3D,Castable Resin,EasyCast HD Brown,Cleaning and Curing,0.05mm,8,80,13,0,0,Chitubox,nmcvaugh,"Castable considerations apply - use a ludicrous amount of heavy supports, print vertically, use print bed adhesion technique such as a solid base layer to improve adhesion. Note curing instructions from manufacturer (see link)."

Siraya Tech Blu Clear,,Blu Clear,Amazon,0.05mm,8,75,13,0,0,Chitubox,Jeff Turner,Heated enclosure to 34 degrees.  Comes off build plate like a charm. VERY FLEXIBLE!  These numbers might be improvedwith more testing.  5 bottom layers at 65 sec was a little sketchy. 11 sec per layer worked but upped to 13 to be safe
